#Heuristics Design 

**Visibility of system status**
-   When user comments on a chat room, other users are able to see it without refreshing their page.
    Our system use of Socket.io allows users to be informed and updated real-time on what is going on.
 
**Match between system and the real world**
-   Our system uses users' language that are relatable and welcoming to the user. We implement this on all our
    pages so that the user is able to use our app without much difficulty as the wordings provide a general
    idea on the page they are currently on or what the different pages are for in the case of the homepage.
    For example, our chat box are named after different symptoms that user may feel and follow real-world conventions.

**User control and freedom**
-   Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to
    leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
-   We implemented a back button on the application so that the user is able to go back to the previous
    page as needed.
 
**Consistency and standards**
-   As shown by our layout of different chatrooms, our system keeps consistency in different design elements
    on our website, which minimizes confusions by users.
 
**Error prevention**
-   Our system accounts for error-prone conditions by using the Twitter API to validate user accounts and to
    provide good error messages.
 
**Recognition rather than recall**
-   Our team implemented a search bar on all chat room to minimize user's memory load as the user can find past
    history using our function. User do not need to remember past information as they can retrieve that
    information through the search bar.
 
###Flexibility and efficiency of use
-   By allowing our users to press "Enter" to submit a message, it speeds up communication between our users
    and make our system more efficient for users who utilize this function often.

###Aesthetic and minimalist design
-   Our system keeps a minimalist design that focuses mainly on the different chatroom and in creating a
    calming, safe environment for our users. We organize our application to contain only information as needed.
 
###Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
-   Our system provides messages to help users recover from errors through using the Twitter API and by creating a documentation page.

###Help and documentation
-   Our system has a simple, minimalist "learn page" that helps users familiarize themselves with the functions
    provided by our application.
