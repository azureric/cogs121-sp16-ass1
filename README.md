#Heuristics Design 

**Visibility of system status**
-   When user comments on a chat room, other users are able to see it without refreshing their page.
    Our system use of Socket.io allows users to be informed and updated real-time on what is going on.
 
**Match between system and the real world**
-   Our system utilizes user's language  that matches real world and allow user to be able to use our app without much difficulty as the wordings follow real-world conventions. 

**User control and freedom**
-   Our team implemented a back button on the application so that the user is able to go back to the previous
    page as needed.
 
**Consistency and standards**
-   As shown by our layout of different chatrooms, our system keeps consistency in different design elements and functions on our website, which minimizes confusions by users. 
 
**Error prevention**
-   Our team implemented form validation which alerts users if they type in no word or more than 1500 words in our chatroom. 
 
**Recognition rather than recall**
-   Our team implemented a search bar on all chat room to minimize user's memory load as the user can find past history using our function. 
 
**Flexibility and efficiency of use**
-   By allowing our users to press "Enter" to submit a message, it speeds up communication between our users
    and make our system more efficient for users who utilize this function often.

**Aesthetic and minimalist design**
-   Our system keeps a minimalist design through minimizing the amount of texts on all the sites and centeralizing it to focus on the different chatroom, and creating a calming, safe environment for our users.

 
**Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
-   Our system provides pop-up alert messages to help users recognize errors and fix them. 

**Help and documentation**
-   Our system has a simple, minimalist "learn page" when user logs in to help users familiarize themselves with the functions provided.
