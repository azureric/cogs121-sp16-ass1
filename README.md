#App Name: Got the Feels
Got the Feels is an app dedicated to confronting the stigma of mental health and encouraging conversations about anxiety, depression, and other related mental health issues as a means of coping, sharing and recovery. It's okay to feel anxious. You're not alone when you're feeling down. Got the Feels creates a safe-space to talk about insecurities and vulnerability, while fostering a supportive community to grow and embrace problems together.

#Heuristics Design 

**Visibility of system status**
-   When a user comments on a chat room, the message automatically appears for other users on the same page, allowing them to see it without refreshing their page. Our system use of Socket.io allows users to be informed and updated real-time on what is going on.
 
**Match between system and the real world**
-   Our system utilizes user's language that matches real world and allow user to be able to use our app without much difficulty as the wordings follow real-world conventions. For example, we chose to use the term "depressed" rather than "sad" because we believe using the most specific terms really confronts the mental health issue and stigma that we want to discuss.

**User control and freedom**
-   Our team implemented a back button on every page of application to so that the user is able to go back to the previous
    page and especially the homepage easily and as needed.
 
**Consistency and standards**
-   As shown by our layout of different chatrooms, our system keeps consistency in different design elements and functions on our website, which minimizes confusion by users. Although each chat is different to mark uniqueness, shown through color and a title, the overall design layout and concept is the same. The community support room, which is most different from the other rooms in terms of functionality, also contains the most different chatroom appearance even though it still follows the same general concept of all the chatrooms.
 
**Error prevention**
-   Our team implemented form validation which alerts users if they type in no word or more than 1500 words in our chatroom. 
 
**Recognition rather than recall**
-   At the top of each chat room, we display a search bar to minimize the user's memory load and allow the user to easily find past history and filter through posts using keywords or word phrases. We also use the same emoticons to represent specific emotions from the sign-in screen to the homepage so users can begin to easily recognize which emoticons represent what emotion on our app. 
 
**Flexibility and efficiency of use**
-   By allowing our users to press "Enter" to submit a message, it speeds up communication between our users
    and make our system more efficient for users who utilize this function often. We also have a static menu bar while you scroll on the homepage so the user can quickly navigate away from the homepage when desired.

**Aesthetic and minimalist design**
-   Our system keeps a minimalist design through minimizing the amount of texts on all the sites and centeralizing it to focus on the different chatroom, and creating a calming, safe environment for our users. Our functions are simple to use and we do not have any clustered buttons or paragraphs that may degrade our minimalist design.

**Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
-   Our system provides pop-up alert messages to help users recognize errors and fix them.

**Help and documentation**
-   Our system has a simple, minimalist tutorial both before a user logs in and after. The tutorial is available before logging in so that it can attract users who may not know enough about the app yet or want to first familiarize themselves with the functions provided. After logging in, we provide the same tutorial as a resource in case our users run into any problems or questions.
