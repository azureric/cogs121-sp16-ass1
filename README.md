#Heuristics Design 

##Visibility of system status
- When user comments on a chat room, other users are able to see it without refreshing their page. Our system use of Socket.io allows users to be informed and updated real-tine on what is going on. 
 
##Match between system and the real world
- Our system uses users' language that are relatable and welcoming to the user. For example, our chat box are named after different symptoms that user may feel and follow real-world conventions. 

##User control and freedom
-
Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
 
##Consistency and standards
- As shown by our layout of different chatrooms, our system keeps consistency in different design elements on our website, which minimizes confusions by users. 
 
##Error prevention
- Our system accounts for error-prone conditions by using the Twitter API to validate user accounts and to provide good error messages.
 
##Recognition rather than recall
- Our team implemented a search bar on all chat room to minimize user's memory load as user can find past history using our function. User do not need to remember past information as they can retrieve that information through the search bar. 
 
##Flexibility and efficiency of use
- By allowing our users to press "Enter" to submit a message, it speeds up communication between our users and make our system more efficient for users who utilize this function often. 

 
##Aesthetic and minimalist design
-- Our system keeps a minimalist design that focuses mainly on the different chatroom and in creating a calming, safe environment for our users. We organize our application to contain only information as needed. 
 
##Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
 
##Help and documentation
-- Our system has a simple, minimalist "learn page" that helps users familize themselves with the functions provided by our application.
